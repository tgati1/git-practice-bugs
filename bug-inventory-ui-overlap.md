# Bug Report: UI Inventory Overlap

# Summary: When opening the inventory on a low-resolution Android device, some UI elements overlap.

# Steps to reproduce: 
    1. Log in on any/multiple low-spec/low-resolution Android device(s),
    2. Open character inventory,
    3. Notice overlap of item names and item icons.

# Expected result: Low resolution devices should also be able to open character inventory without causing any overlaps.

# Actual result: The low resolution is somehow affecting the appearance of the inventory tab, causing the items in it to be unidentifiable by players.

# Severity: High - needs fix asap.

# Environment: older or lower-end devices with screen resolutions less than 320 x 480 pixels; bug has been found in multiple models, screenshots attached below:
