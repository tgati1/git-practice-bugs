# Smoke Testing
“Does the app launch without exploding?”
A quick check to make sure the basic functionality works after a build—before deeper testing. Think of it as “sanity testing.”

# Sanity Testing
“Did the new fix actually fix it?”
Focused testing on one area, often after a bug fix or patch—checking that the fix worked and didn’t break anything nearby.

# Exploratory Testing
“What happens if I try weird things?”
QA tests without predefined test cases—they use instinct, experience, and creativity to find unexpected bugs.

# Ad-hoc Testing
Unstructured, random testing. Similar to exploratory, but usually less documented. Fast, chaotic bug hunting.

# Security Testing
Ensures that data is protected and the app isn’t vulnerable to attacks (e.g., login bypass, input injection, access control failures).

# Usability Testing
Checks if the app is easy and pleasant to use. Focus is on UI, layout, navigation, and overall user satisfaction.
